# evaluating_job_listings
this code was used in the course "Data Gathering and Management Lab" in the Technion by Sivan, Yuval and Bar.

the ipynb files were run in the Microsoft DataBricks enviroment to process the data.
the py files were used locally to extract inputs to feed the models.


to use this code:
<br>
upload the data analysis notebook.ipynb file to a Pyspark enabled system
<br>
use the "scraping.py" to scrape wanted job postings and place them in a folder
<br>
use json cleaner.py to cosolidate all json files
<br>
upload the files to the server and connect the "companies" table path and your data path

run all and enjoy!
